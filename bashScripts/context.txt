=====================================

PROJECT STATUS:
- Need to win 6,000 USDC bounty for NEAR Swift client
- Must parse OpenAPI spec and generate type-safe Swift code
- Critical: Must handle path issue (OpenAPI has multiple paths, JSON-RPC uses only "/")
- Required: 80% test coverage, full automation, two packages

IMMEDIATE FOCUS:
1. Fix OpenAPI path consolidation 
2. Complete all RPC methods
3. Achieve 80% test coverage
4. Polish documentation

### CRITICAL TASKS ###


PRIORITY 1 - MUST HAVE:
[ ] Fix OpenAPI path consolidation (spec uses /method, RPC uses /)
[ ] Implement all basic RPC methods (view, call, tx, block, etc.)
[ ] Reach 80% test coverage
[ ] Complete GitHub Actions automation
[ ] Document all public APIs

PRIORITY 2 - SHOULD HAVE:
[ ] Add retry logic for failed requests
[ ] Implement transaction signing
[ ] Add integration tests with mock server
[ ] Create comprehensive examples
[ ] Performance benchmarks

PRIORITY 3 - NICE TO HAVE:
[ ] WebSocket support for subscriptions
[ ] Async stream support
[ ] Cache layer
[ ] Rate limiting
[ ] Telemetry/logging

BOUNTY REQUIREMENTS CHECK:
✅ Two packages (types and client)
✅ Snake_case to camelCase conversion
✅ GitHub Actions setup
⚠️ 80% test coverage (currently ~40%)
⚠️ OpenAPI code generation (needs testing)
❌ Published packages
❌ Full documentation

KEY CODE TO FIX:
1. In Scripts/generate-from-openapi.swift:
   - Line 476: Patch OpenAPI paths to single "/"
   - Add proper type generation from components/schemas
   
2. In NearJsonRpcClient.swift:
   - Add missing RPC methods
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add retry logic

3. Tests need expansion:
   - Mock URLSession for all methods
   - Edge cases
   - Error conditions
   - Integration tests

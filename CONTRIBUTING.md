## Development Setup

### Requirements

* Swift 5.9 or later
* macOS 13+ or Linux with Swift toolchain
* GitHub CLI (`gh`) for workflow triggers (optional)

### Build & Test

```bash
swift build
swift test --enable-code-coverage
```

### Run RPC Smoke Test

```bash
swift run
```

---

## Code Style

* Use Swiftâ€™s native `Codable` for all serialization/deserialization.
* Prefer **`camelCase`** for Swift naming (auto-converted from API `snake_case`).
* Keep packages minimal and focused:

  * `NearJsonRpcTypes`: *types only*.
  * `NearJsonRpcClient`: *RPC methods only*.
* Always include **unit tests** for new types or client methods.

---

## Automated Workflows

* **CI (Swift CI):** builds and tests every push/PR.
* **Regeneration:** regenerates from OpenAPI spec (manual + nightly).
* **Release:** versioning and tagging are automated with `release-please`.

To run regeneration manually:

```bash
gh workflow run manual-regenerate.yml
```
